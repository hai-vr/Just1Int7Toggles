# *Just 1 Int ⇒ 7 Toggles (J1I7T)* 🗡️

*Just 1 Int 7 Toggles* was an Unity Editor tool that would let you use just 1 Expression Parameter to create a menu with 7 Toggles.

**In January 2021, VRChat has pushed an update that introduced synced booleans to Avatars 3.0,
allowing avatars to contain much more synced parameters  🎉**

This update makes J1I7T redundant. For this reason, this project will no longer be maintained! 😃

If you still need an animation generator for your toggles, please switch to another inventory management Unity editor script.
